# Whirly Bird :duck: 

**Whirly Bird** is a reimagination of the famous game Flappy Bird created by Dong Nguyen, in which the player jumps through a series of pillars to score infinitely. This project was made in **Godot 4** with Mono support and **all scripts were written in C#**.

## About :book:

I've created this game as a study project to learn how to use the Godot Engine and try to make a simple game in it, as close to production level as possible.

## Features :star2:

### Smooth, Stylized and Responsive Gameplay

Quick and snappy jumps, forgiving gravity, and comprehensive visual & audio feedback help the player have an easier time with the game.

### Adaptive Difficulty

The game's speed adjusts whenever the player reaches certain score thresholds, offering a continuously challenging experience.

### Encrypted High Scores in Local Save File

High scores are stored in an encrypted local save, deterring most save tampering attempts.

### Configurable Settings

Gameplay parameters are easily tuned via JSON files, making it easy for all developers to make adjustments to the game's balance.

### Easy-to-use tweening scripts

All game animations are done using Godot's new tweening system, to simplify animations like movement, scaling, rotation, and fading.
